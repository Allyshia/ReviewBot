Review Bot is a tool for automating static analysis of code posted to
a Review Board instance. When a review request is posted, Review Bot
executes the installed static analysis plugins, and posts the results
as code comments in a new review.

Review Bot consists of two parts: a Review Board extension for
triggering reviews, and worker code to execute the static analysis
tools. Execution of the tools is accomplished by distributed task
workers using Celery (http://www.celeryproject.org/).
